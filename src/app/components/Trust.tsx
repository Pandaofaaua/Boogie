          I&apos;ve been active in the Web3 space since 2019, contributing
          across communities, testnets, and blockchain ecosystems. My experience
          spans community management, onboarding, and hands-on participation
          with emerging protocols.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-lg font-body text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I understand how Web3 projects operate — from credibility and
          visibility to community growth and ecosystem participation. This
          allows me to present work clearly, honestly, and in a way that
          resonates with crypto-native audiences.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-lg font-body text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          My focus is on clarity, accuracy, and long-term credibility over hype.
